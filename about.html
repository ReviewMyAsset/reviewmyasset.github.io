            <p>Hi there,</p>
            <p>I'm Anubha, and let me tell you, I have a fantastic relationship with money. When I first attained my qualification as a chartered accountant, I was bombarded with the same question from people seeking advice: "Where should I invest my money? Which shares should I buy?" It seemed like everyone was seeking advice, but what they got was either generic recommendations or suggestions that led to better commissions.</p>
            <p>Deep down, I knew there had to be a better way to select investment products. However, being a 21-year-old with limited life and career experience, who would take me seriously? I was torn between my knowledge and the prevailing outdated practices of relying on random advice.</p>
            <p>But I didn't let that stop me. Over the years, I decided to put my beliefs into practice, starting with myself and my two guinea pigsâ€”my father and my father-in-law. As they witnessed the positive results of my structured investment decisions, my family and friends began to see the sense in my approach and joined in. The returns over time, the peace of mind, and the overall well-being that followed from making informed decisions were game changers for them.</p>
            <p>It became clear to me that achieving financial well-being requires education and awareness, which the conventional approach or advisors couldn't provide. That realization inspired me to create Review My Asset.</p>
            <p>I am fuelled by my unwavering commitment to excellence, and I am willing to go the extra mile to help you make confident decisions. As a professional advisor, I firmly believe in maintaining a positive mindset and building long-term partnerships based on trust.</p>
            <p>Thank you for taking the time to stop by and learn about my journey.</p>
            <p>Warm regards,</p>
            <p>Anubha</p>
